With privilege comes responsibility. We have a lot of work to achieve and challenges to overcome.<\/p>\n<p>I joined the field of liver transplantation in 2000 and since then, I have witnessed tremendous changes and innovations. These achievements were made possible through the implementation of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach for patient care, as well as the sharing of knowledge and experience between different subspecialties.<\/p>\n<p>The Egyptian Liver Transplantation Society (ELTS) represents all professionals involved in liver transplantation in Egypt. Our society includes surgeons, hepatologists, anesthetists, pediatricians, radiologists, pathologists, and specialists in infectious diseases and rehabilitation. Our society also includes pharmacists, nutritionists, nurses, coordinators, social workers, and financial advisors who have a vital role in the complex transplant process.<\/p>\n<p>ELTS is the professional voice of Liver transplantation in Egypt providing leadership, representation, and guidance for the benefit of our patients. We strongly encourage all those working in the field to become members to enable us to be truly representative of our wide community and make that all members are heard.<\/p>\n<p>I am proud of the group of executive leaders and councilors from all Egyptian centers. With them, we will be able to make our society very strong. I will draw all possible support from both senior and young members of the society during my time in office, to make this organization relevant and valuable to various stakeholders. We will also include the smaller programs and their leaders who will help craft the direction of our society. The daily changes in the world around us demand that we keep an open eye on how our society operates for the sake of our patients.<\/p>\n<p>ELTS will be actively involved in developing national policies; commenting to the media on all issues related to liver transplantation; and, of course, developing the scientific, clinical, and ethical practices that we all experience on a daily basis.<\/p>\n<p>It is my goal as the first ELTS President to build up a strong society by focusing on the following objectives:<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Advocacy for our patients and professionals working in the field of liver transplant.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Support of professionals working in the field of liver transplantation by providing a lot of education, research, and training opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Help ELTS members advance their individual careers.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Work with all experts in the liver transplantation community to develop guidelines and consensus recommendations related to all aspects of liver transplantation.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Collaborate and build up strong ties with all recognized international societies in the field of transplantation.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Provide needed help to develop liver transplantation programs in Egypt.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Outreach to other countries in the Middle East and Africa to help them to develop liver transplantation programs.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Help in the establishment of National registry for liver transplant in Egypt.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Help in establishment of deceased donor liver transplantation program in Egypt.<\/p>\n<p>Excellence, collaboration, advocacy, and integrity will constitute our core values. We will commit to serve all members and patients by creating a community of practice in Transplanting HOPE.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m pleased to serve and work for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prof Dr Amr Abdelaal.<\/strong><\/div>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner el_class=&#8221;PresidentImgeClmForMob&#8221; width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;10px&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7041&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Prof. Dr Amr Abdelaal&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h5|text_align:center|color:%23ffffff&#8221; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1649526705917{background-color: #23589c !important;}&#8221; el_class=&#8221;MPresident&#8221;][vc_column el_class=&#8221;imgHome&#8221;][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Message from President&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:center|color:%23ffffff&#8221; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221;][vc_separator color=&#8221;white&#8221; el_width=&#8221;50&#8243;][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner el_class=&#8221;PresidentImgeClmWeb&#8221; width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;10px&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7041&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Prof. Dr Amr Abdelaal&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h5|text_align:center|color:%23ffffff&#8221; google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Raleway%3A100%2C200%2C300%2Cregular%2C500%2C600%2C700%2C800%2C900|font_style:700%20bold%20regular%3A700%3Anormal&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner el_class=&#8221;PresidentIMSGclm&#8221; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text el_class=&#8221;PresidentMsg&#8221;] Dear Colleagues, I am honored and privileged to be elected to serve you as the first President of the Egyptian Liver Transplantation Society (ELTS).
